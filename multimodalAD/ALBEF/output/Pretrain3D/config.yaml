# Training Hyperparameters for SMALL DATA (7 Subjects)
# Batch size MUST be smaller than 7. We use 2.
# 7 items / batch 2 = 3 batches per epoch (1 item dropped due to drop_last=True)
batch_size: 2

# Queue size must be divisible by batch_size. 
# 64 is small enough for this test but large enough to hold the features.

# Optimizer & Scheduler
# We increase epochs because the dataset is tiny, so one epoch is very fast.
